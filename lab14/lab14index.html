					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> The main challenge I faced was remembering how to properly impliment images in html and centering them. 
                        After some troubleshooting I just made my own folder for the images in the same one as this lab, and I had 
                    to play around in CSS for a bit but I got my images to center by just giving them a unique ID so it wouldn't effect the 
                    other sections.  </p>
