                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p> at first my code I was practicing wasn't working at all in JS bin and then I put it
                    into my javascript and it still didn't work so I re-wrote it looking at the screenshots from 
                    the assignment but I was still having trouble. So I decided to talk to ChatGBT about it and it helped 
                    me figure out what was wrong. First my html didn't match the IDs in my JS and then I had to
                    re-do my js with ChatGBT to make it JQuery which took a couple tries but everything works now! </p>
            </div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>please enter your FULL name for sorting</p>

                    <div id="output" placeholder="Sorting results will appear here"></div>
