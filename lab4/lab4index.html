			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>my initial challeneges consisted of just coming up with things to make lists about but thanks to my awesome partner 
						Nicole we overcame that quickly! We went back and forth a lot helping eachother come up with ideas.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some problems with my lists and images but after looking up how to organize sub lists in an ordered list I was able to figure it out. 
						I also used what Ilia pointed out in section about adding ".." before the image name to help vscode know where to look for the image and it worked great. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was generally simple, I think the most difficulty I had here was just figuring out what to put where exactly, the instructions on canvas are a little confusing.
						I think I have it right, though. Learning about the different tags for each language is starting to get confusing but I know with a quick glance back at 
					my notes or the lecture I can easily jog my memory. I'm hoping it gets easier with more practice </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> here is our first outline on how to make pasta from scratch:
						<ol>
						<li>Get ingredients</li>
							<ul>- Two cups of flour</ul>
							<ul>- 2 large eggs</ul>
							<ul>- 3 egg yolks</ul>
						<li> Form pasta dough </li>
						<ul> Make well with flour</ul>
						<ul>Add eggs to flour and mix with fork </ul>
						<li>knead dough for 8-10 mins</li>
						<li>Let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes</li>
						<li>Using a pasta machine or rolling pin, roll the dough out lengthwise slightly</li>
						<li>On a lightly floured surface, fold the pasta dough in thirds</li>
						<li>Repeat these 2 steps until the pasta dough is smooth</li>
						<li>Roll the dough out until it is around 1/16 inch thick</li>
						<li>Cut pasta into sheets, around 12-14 inches long</li>
						<li>Dust both sides of the dough with flour</li>
						<li>After cutting to desired shape, stack pasta to the side and cover with a clean, dampened kitchen towel</ol>
						<H2> Go Fish Pseudocode:</H2>
						<pre><code>//Go Fish!
// Load players with 7 cards
	// Randomly load cards from the deck
		// Each card delt is removed from the deck
// first player clicks card in hand wanting to be matched
	// Check if the other player has a matching card
      // If yes: give to player 
      // If no: “go fish” message
        // Allow player to draw from random pile
// other player’s turn
// check for win condition
  // When all cards in possession are pairs, player with most pairs wins</code></pre>
