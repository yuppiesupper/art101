			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>my main challenge was just sitting down at my computer and coding honestly, I had to teach mysself a couple things so I think that deterred me from 
						getting it done sooner. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> My js was printing with "NaN" at the end of my string but when I went and used the code directly from
						the directions on canvas it worked. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This lab was a little hard just because I missed lecture on friday so I went back and watched the lecture
						to make sure I could get the hang of it. My partner and I had busy weekends so communication was a little delayed
					but we figured it out in the end. </p>
